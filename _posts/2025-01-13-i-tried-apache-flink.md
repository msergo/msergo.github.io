title: I Tried Apache Flink and Found It a Great Tool
---

**NB:** This post is a publishing of some earlier drafts.

I've been exploring tools for data stream processing, and I ended up choosing Apache Flink.  
First of all, it caught my attention thanks to its excellent documentation and quick-start examples.

Some time ago, I worked on another pet project using ADS sensor data ([see here](https://github.com/msergo/flying-pigs-hazelcast)). This time, I wanted to build something similar using Flink.

It turned into a fun project to track landed planes.
