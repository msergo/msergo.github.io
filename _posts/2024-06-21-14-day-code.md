Deadlines are essential.
Having a final date pushes you to advance the progress. 

Some random guy from dou.ua decided to make a 14 days of code challenge and I am in. 
So far I updated 2 of my "sleepy" projects and it makes a lot of fun:
 * a [boilerplate](https://github.com/msergo/flink-rabbitmq-source-boilerplate) for Apache Flink pipelines
 * new look for my [local radio player](https://github.com/msergo/mplayer-pi)

A [GO-project](https://github.com/msergo/eki_telegram_bot) is coming next. 

Thanks for [the initiative!](https://code2weeks.online/Leaderboard)
