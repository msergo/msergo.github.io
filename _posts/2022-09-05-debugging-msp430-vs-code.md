title:  "Debugging MSP430 in VS Code"
---

My experience with embedded systems is rather small and related to pet projects only. 


So far I've been tinkering with 8-bit [AVR's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers), 16- and 32-bit [chips by Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI_MSP430) and [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) SoCs. I would not count Raspberry Pi in this list (there's even one  Pi Zero working at my home). 


And there's an absolute leader in my personal list: Texas Instruments. Reasons: great documentation, great selection of launchpads and also community. These guys are also crazy about low-power consumption.
There are also tradeoffs as always. In my opinion, their standard IDE [Code Composer Studioâ„¢](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO) is too heavy and not working that great under Linux. 

One obvious way to tackle the problem is to use a GCC compiler in combination with VS Code. While playing around with this setup, I found out for myself how gdb works and how lightweight the embedded-development setup might be.

My current setup:


  * Arch Linux (Linux version 5.19.6-arch1-1 (linux@archlinux) (gcc (GCC) 12.2.0, GNU ld (GNU Binutils) 2.39.0)
  * [MSPDebug](https://github.com/dlbeer/mspdebug): the debugging tool
  * [MSP430Ware](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSPWARE): native libs and bindings from Texas Instruments
  * Visual Studio Code 1.71.0
  * [MSP430F5529 Launchpad](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP430F5529LP/) from ancient 2014 or so

  
The process

0. Create a project and write your code
1. Point VS code for libraries in order to use includes in `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json`
2. Add a `Makefile`
3. Define some tasks for easy debugging in `.vscode/tasks.json`
```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "type": "shell",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "debug-only",
            "isBackground": true,
            "command": "mspdebug tilib \"gdb\"",
        },
    ]
}
```
4. Configure debug configs in `.vscode/launch.json` file
```json
 "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Debugger",
            "type": "cppdbg",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "MSP430F5529.out",
            "miDebuggerPath": "/opt/ti/msp430-gcc/bin/msp430-elf-gdb",
            "miDebuggerServerAddress": ":2000",
            "args": [],
            "stopAtEntry": true,
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "environment": [],
            "externalConsole": false,
            "logging": {
                "engineLogging": true
            },
            "preLaunchTask": "debug-only",
            "serverLaunchTimeout": 100000  // add timeaout because preLaunchTask will run in a background, so we can't really monitor it's status
        },
    ]
```

5. Now, we can build and flash the code. Actually, this can also be in a `preLaunch` task as well.

```shell
$ make

> /opt/ti/msp430-gcc/bin/msp430-elf-gcc -I /opt/ti/msp430-gcc/include -mmcu=MSP430F5529 -O0 -Wall -g3 -gdwarf-2 -ggdb -L /opt/ti/msp430-gcc/include -Wl,-Map,main.map,--gc-sections  main.o -o MSP430F5529.out

$ mspdebug tilib "prog MSP430F5529.out"

Boom, it's there! Now you can actually debug. 

Let's launch the config from step 4.

```shell
Executing task: mspdebug tilib "gdb"

Done. Now you can use breakpoints, access registers and actually debug the code. In the "Debug console" tab you can also see gdb logs.
